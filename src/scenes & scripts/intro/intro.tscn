The facility is infested with the monsters he created, who have long since woken up. They are far stronger, yet more horrid than you are. Their deadly energy itself is enough to finish you off. However, they are mindless and may fail to notice you. Therefore, try to jump over them, and you will survive.

Zodric wishes you luck.

Controls:
- Jump: W - up arrow - space
- Right: D- right arrow 
- Left: A - left arrow"
