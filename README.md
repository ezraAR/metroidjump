# metroidjump
A repository for my indie game, "Metroidjump".

Made by Azlan Rafiq

Metroidjump, a game of jumping, was created with the _Godot_ game engine.

The point of the game is to get to the exit while evading the monsters within. You get points for successfully jumping over an enemy. However, if you do not manage to evade, the enemy will attack and your health will decrease. If your health drops to zero, you die. 

Both the source code and builds (for windows and android) are located in this repository.
